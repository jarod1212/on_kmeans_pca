PROJECT: "ON K-MEANS AND PCA" by JAROD LEVY AND PIERRE BEAULIEU 

The contents of this repository are organized as follows:

	Report (6 pages excluding Figures and References):
This report offers a detailed theoretical framework and presents the conclusions drawn from our various experiments.

	Code: 4 notebooks and 1 utility files
These notebooks outline the experiments conducted and provide the methodology, results, figures, and analyses.

PGM1: Replication and extension of the Internet Newsgroup Experiment.
PGM2: Examination of the impact of initialization parameters.
PGM3: Comprehensive analysis of a new dataset: the PFAM dataset.
PGM4: Exploration of non-linearity and noise robustness, including a comparative study with Gaussian Mixture Models.
utils: Contains all essential methods required to execute the code (notably KMeans and PCA implementation).
Illustrations: UMAP visualizations of the PFAM dataset

	Data Folder:
While not inclusive of all utilized data, this folder contains key documents necessary for replicating the Internet Newsgroup Experiment (change the corresponding path).

	Contribution Document:
Outlines the specific contributions of each participant in the project.
